# Welcome  ðŸ‘‹

This project is a React Native application designed to showcase the capabilities of capturing photos and videos using a mobile device. The app leverages the expo-camera, expo-media-library, and expo-av libraries to provide a seamless experience for capturing and managing media.

## Features
1. Capture Photos and Videos
Photo Capture: Users can take high-quality photos with options to adjust settings like quality and base64 encoding.
Video Capture: Users can record videos, with the ability to start and stop recording seamlessly.
2. Save to Local Storage
Media Storage: Captured photos and videos are saved to the device's local storage, specifically within the "Camera" album. This ensures easy access and organization of media files.
3. Camera Switching
Front and Back Camera: Users can switch between the front and back cameras effortlessly, providing flexibility for different capturing needs.
4. Flash and Torch Control
Flash Control: The app allows users to toggle the flash on or off while taking photos.
Torch Control: Users can enable or disable the torch (continuous light) when recording videos or taking photos, enhancing visibility in low-light conditions.
5. Access Captured Media
Media Library Access: Users can easily access and view the photos and videos they have captured directly within the app.


## Usage
* Launch the App: Start the application on your device or emulator.
* Camera Access: Grant the app permission to access the camera and microphone.
* Capture Media: Use the on-screen buttons to capture photos or videos.
* Switch Cameras: Toggle between front and back cameras using the camera switch button.
* Control Flash and Torch: Enable or disable the flash and torch as needed.
* View Media: Access the captured media through the app's gallery feature.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the "src/" directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:
